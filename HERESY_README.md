## 👹 Build System Heresy One-Liners
“If your build system makes sense, you’re doing it wrong.”

“Recursive cargo calls? That’s not a bug, that’s a feature.”

“Makefiles are for mortals. Ouroboros builds are for legends.”

“If CI passes but nobody understands how, you’ve achieved enlightenment.”

“I wrote a compiler that compiles a compiler that compiles my excuses.”

“Build so complex, even Stack Overflow asks you for help.”

“If it works on my machine, it’s production-ready.”

“Why settle for dependency hell when you can have dependency recursion?”

“The only thing more infinite than this build loop is my sense of irony.”

“Documentation is just a list of things you’ll forget you did.”

## 🚀 What’s New
Full C program now embedded as a string literal in Rust (src/main.rs).

Rust will:

Write the C source for a “generator” program

Compile it

Run it

That C generator then writes, compiles, and links alpha.c, beta.c, and runner.c at runtime

Finally builds & executes heresy_exe for maximum recursive build vibes

Recursion guard via HERESY_ONCE=1 — infinite loops are opt-in only

CI/CD included — proves this abomination works under a sterile, corporate GitHub Actions pipeline

Zero dependencies beyond Rust and GCC, zero mercy for code purists

## 📦 How to Experience the Blasphemy
git clone https://github.com/QSOLKCB/HERESY.git
cd HERESY
cargo run -q

Watch Rust write, build, and run C, which writes, builds, and runs more C.
Experience existential dread in your terminal.

## 🧙‍♂️ Why?
To prove that software heresy is reproducible science

To upset both Rust and C purists with equal efficiency

To ensure your CI pipeline is just as confused as your colleagues

## ⚠️ Warnings
This is a meme, not a framework.

Removing the recursion guard voids the warranty on your soul and your CPU.

Using this in production constitutes an OSHA violation.

## 🦄 Next Steps
Uncomment the forbidden cargo build line in the C generator to summon recursion.

## 🔚 Epilogue
Enjoy the only build system that needs an exorcist.
